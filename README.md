# Fast Food
This project is the food orther app presenting basic usage of react.js
You can simply add meals to cart, check your cart content and remove/add meals from cart itself.

### Step 1
Unzip the contents to a destination folder of your choice. Once unzipped, run the following commands in the terminal. Note that `npm install` will take a bit as it installs quite a few packages.

```
cd /path/to/your/unzipped/dir
npm install
npm start
```

This will initiate a development server on port 3000 by default. It will usually spawn a browser window to this address upon boot, but if it doesnt, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Step 2
After you're finished saving your changes and you're ready to use this template on your server, exit the `npm start` module by using `Ctrl + C` and issue the following command.

```
npm run build
```

This will take around one minute in most cases and you will notice a `build` folder in your unzipped directory location. Take the contents of this folder and upload them to your server.

That's it! Your React app is now running with a single minified HTML file.
